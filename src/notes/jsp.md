# Java Server Pages (JSP)
JSP allows us to create HTML pages with dynamic content by letting us mix Java code into our HTML. 
Using JSPs is much easier than writing HTML inside of strings inside of servlets.

While our servlets reside in src/main/java, we'll create our JSPs inside of src/main/webapp, as they are not Java source code.
